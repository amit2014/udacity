## This Repository
This is the repository for all Udacity DAN projects. Each folder corresponds
to one of the 7 projects required to complete the program.

### [Test a Perceptual Phenomenon](https://github.com/jasonicarter/udacity/tree/master/P1_StroopEffect)

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect,
a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data
and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

### [Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/jasonicarter/udacity/tree/master/P2_Titanic_Data_Analysis)

Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas.
Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

### [Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data](https://github.com/jasonicarter/udacity/tree/master/P3_OpenStreeMap_Data_MongoDB)

Choose any area of the world in [OpenStreeMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and use data munging techniques,
such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity,
to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about.

### Explore and Summarize Data

Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables
and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

### Identify Fraud from Enron Email

Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees
who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

### Make Effective Data Visualization

Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data.
Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory
and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

### Design an A/B Test

Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run.
Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.
